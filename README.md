> **A foundation for digital sovereignty, truth, and decentralized family values.**

## Purpose & Vision

The Sovereign Family Ecosystem is a comprehensive platform for achieving complete technological independence at the family level. This repository provides the infrastructure for local-first AI co-pilots, blockchain integration, decentralized storage, and multi-generational legacy preservation.

## Core Principles

- **Digital Sovereignty**: Complete technological independence from centralized platforms
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven decision making and transparent operations
- **Constitutional Foundation**: Built on eternal principles of liberty and truth
- **Family-First Design**: Technology that serves families, not corporations

## Constitutional Foundation

This ecosystem is governed by the **[Universal Declaration of Digital Sovereignty](docs/declaration.md)** - our constitutional document establishing fundamental rights and principles for digital independence.

## Key Features

### Local-First AI Co-Pilots

Run AI models locally on your own hardware. No cloud dependencies, no data leakage, complete privacy and control.

### Blockchain Integration

Native integration with PulseChain and Dysnomia for decentralized finance, smart contracts, and sovereign economic activity.

### IPFS Storage

Decentralized file storage using IPFS ensures your family's data is distributed, redundant, and censorship-resistant.

### Multi-Generational Legacy Preservation

Archive and preserve family knowledge, documents, and wisdom for future generations with cryptographic verification and permanent storage.

### Divine Council Multi-Agent Systems

Coordinate multiple AI agents working together to serve family needs - from education to finance to health management.

## Architecture

The Sovereign Family Ecosystem consists of four primary layers:

1. **Infrastructure Layer**: Self-hosted servers, IPFS nodes, blockchain validators
2. **Application Layer**: AI co-pilots, family management tools, educational platforms
3. **Data Layer**: Encrypted local storage, distributed backups, blockchain anchoring
4. **Interface Layer**: Web applications, mobile apps, voice interfaces

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended)
