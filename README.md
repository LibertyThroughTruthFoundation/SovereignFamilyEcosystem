## Purpose & Vision

The Covenant Stack is the technological implementation of a covenant-based life. We provide the open-source infrastructure for families and communities to achieve complete technological and economic independence, operating under divine principle rather than corporate or state control.

This is not merely a collection of tools. It is a **kingdom manifesto with technical implementation**—a digital foundation for those who refuse to bow to the false gods of surveillance capitalism, algorithmic tyranny, and rootless individualism.

---

## Core Principles

The Covenant Stack is governed by four foundational principles that distinguish it from every other technological project:

**Covenant Sovereignty:** Technology must serve under God's authority, facilitating freedom *for* righteousness, not freedom *from* all constraint. We reject the lie that code is law; instead, we affirm that covenant is law, and code is merely a tool for its enforcement.

**Distributed Authority:** Governance is a responsibility entrusted to proven stewards, not an anonymous crowd. Authority is hierarchical and accountable, delegated under shared transcendent principles rather than eliminated through technological sleight of hand.

**Generational Stewardship:** We build not for ourselves, but for our children's children, creating a lasting digital inheritance. Every design decision is measured against the question: "Will this serve the seventh generation?"

**Family as the Foundational Unit:** All technology must strengthen, not replace, the God-ordained family structure. The screen must never supersede the face-to-face. Digital tools exist to serve local, embodied community—not to replace it.

---

## Theological Foundation

This ecosystem is governed by a covenant framework, grounded in the unchanging truth of Scripture. It is a practical outworking of the command to "subdue the earth" and build a society that reflects divine order.

We recognize that all technology is political because it shapes human relations. To build a tool is to make a claim about how people *should* interact. We make that claim explicit: technology should facilitate covenant relationships, righteous stewardship, and the flourishing of families under God's authority.

The Covenant Stack stands in direct opposition to the hollow slogans of modern crypto and tech culture. Where they say "Code is Law," we say "Covenant is Law." Where they say "Trustless," we say "Trust-Worthy." Where they say "Be Your Own Bank," we say "Be a Faithful Steward in a Covenant Community."

For a complete exposition of these principles, see [The 95 Theses of Covenant Finance](https://github.com/LibertyThroughTruthFoundation/95-theses-covenant-finance).

## The Covenant Architecture

The Covenant Stack is organized into four layers, each serving a distinct purpose in the establishment of digital sovereignty:

**The Foundation Layer: Sanctified Ground**

This is the physical and operating system layer—the hardware and base software that must be secured and consecrated for covenant use. It includes sovereign mobile devices running GrapheneOS, self-hosted home servers, and mesh networking infrastructure. Without control of this layer, all higher layers are built on sand.

**The Covenant Layer: Rules of Engagement**

This layer defines identity, governance, and economic protocols. It includes Polycentric identity systems for self-sovereign identity, covenant governance frameworks for community decision-making, and PulseChain integration for sovereign financial activity. This is where the principles are encoded into enforceable rules.

**The Service Layer: The Tools**

This layer provides the practical applications that families and communities need: covenant AI stewards for local, ethical AI assistance; covenant storage (Ark) for distributed, encrypted preservation of family legacy; covenant communication tools for secure, private messaging; and covenant economics for financial stewardship and mutual aid.

**The Interface Layer: The Gates**

This is the user-facing layer—the web, mobile, and voice interfaces that provide access to the covenant world. These interfaces are designed for simplicity and beauty, making the power of the underlying stack accessible to non-technical users.

## Key Features

The Covenant Stack includes the following core capabilities, each renamed to reflect its covenant purpose:

**Covenant AI Stewards:** Local, self-hosted AI that operates under a covenant ethic, protecting your data and aligning its outputs with truth. Unlike corporate AI that serves surveillance and manipulation, Covenant AI serves the family and community, providing assistance without compromise.

**Covenant Economics:** Native integration with PulseChain for sovereign financial activity, designed for stewardship and communal flourishing, not speculation. Includes tools for mutual aid, transparent accounting, and righteous lending.

**Covenant Storage (Ark):** Distributed, encrypted storage for preserving family legacy, Scriptural study, and community history against censorship or loss. Your data is yours, stored on infrastructure you control, preserved for generations.

**Covenant Council Systems:** Multi-agent AI systems designed to assist with family governance, education, and discipleship. These systems provide wise counsel, facilitate decision-making, and support the transmission of values across generations.

## Entering the Covenant

The Covenant Stack is not for everyone. It requires commitment, not just technical skill. Before you begin, you must understand and agree to the covenant principles outlined above.

**Prerequisites:**

A commitment to the covenant principles of sovereignty under God, distributed authority, generational stewardship, and family as the foundational unit. This is not optional. The technology serves the covenant, not the other way around.

Hardware willing to be consecrated for this purpose. At minimum, you will need a device capable of running GrapheneOS (Pixel 6 or newer recommended) or a home server for self-hosting (Raspberry Pi 4 or equivalent).

A willingness to learn and participate in the community. Covenant technology is not a consumer product. It is a shared project that requires active stewardship.

**Installation:**

Detailed installation guides are available in the [documentation](docs/). The process includes securing your hardware, installing the base operating system, configuring covenant services, and connecting to the covenant network.

For those new to self-hosting and digital sovereignty, we recommend starting with the [Quick Start Guide](docs/quick-start.md), which walks through the process step-by-step.

## The Three-Domain Architecture

The Covenant Stack is part of a larger ecosystem of covenant-focused projects and resources:

**LibertyThroughTruthFoundation (GitHub):** The builder's arena. This is where the code lives, where development happens, and where the technical community collaborates. All repositories are open-source and available for audit, contribution, and deployment.

**GodManMarkets.PLS:** The academy for ideas. This is where the theological and economic foundations are taught, including [The 95 Theses of Covenant Finance](https://github.com/LibertyThroughTruthFoundation/95-theses-covenant-finance) and related educational content. This is the "why" behind the "what."

**NationOS.PLS:** The technical specification. This is where the implementation details, architecture documents, and developer guides live. This is the "how" that connects the "why" to the "what."

These three domains work together to provide a complete ecosystem: the ideas, the implementation, and the community.

## Community

The Covenant Stack is built and maintained by a community of believers, builders, and families committed to digital sovereignty under God's authority.
