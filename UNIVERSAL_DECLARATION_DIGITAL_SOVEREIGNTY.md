## Preamble

We, the united citizens of the digital age, in recognition of the inalienable rights bestowed upon all individuals by virtue of their existence, do hereby declare and affirm our unwavering commitment to the principles of digital sovereignty, privacy, and freedom in the realm of technology and digital communication.

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the digital bands which have connected them with tyrannical systems of surveillance and control, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

## Declaration of Self-Evident Truths

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all human beings are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are **Digital Life, Digital Liberty and the pursuit of Digital Happiness**. That to secure these rights, Digital Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Digital Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Digital Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Digital Safety and Happiness.

### Article I: Fundamental Digital Rights

That all individuals possess the inherent and unalienable right to:

*   **Digital Privacy**: The right to conduct digital communications and transactions without surveillance, monitoring, or interference by any government, corporation, or third party
*   *   **Digital Property**: The right to own, control, and transfer digital assets, data, and intellectual property without confiscation or unauthorized access
    *   *   **Digital Expression**: The right to communicate, publish, and express ideas through digital mediums without censorship or suppression
        *   *   **Digital Assembly**: The right to associate and organize with others through digital platforms and networks
            *   *   **Digital Due Process**: The right to fair treatment under digital law and protection from arbitrary digital punishment or restriction
             
                *   ### Article II: Digital Self-Determination
             
                *   That every individual has the sovereign right to determine their own digital destiny, including:
             
                *   *   The choice of digital platforms, services, and technologies they utilize
                    *   *   The right to opt out of any digital system or service without penalty
                        *   *   The right to digital anonymity and pseudonymity when desired
                            *   *   The right to digital self-defense against cyber threats and attacks
                                *   *   The right to digital education and literacy
                                 
                                    *   ## Grievances Against Digital Tyranny
                                 
                                    *   Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Digital Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Digital Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Digital Government, and to provide new Guards for their future digital security.
                                 
                                    *   Such has been the patient sufferance of these Digital Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Digital Government. The history of the present Digital King is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these Digital States.
                                 
                                    *   To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world:
