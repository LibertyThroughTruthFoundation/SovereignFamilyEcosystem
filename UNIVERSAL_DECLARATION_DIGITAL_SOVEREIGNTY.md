# Universal Declaration of Digital Sovereignty

## Preamble

We, the united citizens of the digital age, in recognition of the inalienable rights bestowed upon all individuals by virtue of their existence, do hereby declare and affirm our unwavering commitment to the principles of digital sovereignty, privacy, and freedom in the realm of technology and digital communication.

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the digital bands which have connected them with tyrannical systems of surveillance and control, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

## Declaration of Self-Evident Truths

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all human beings are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are **Digital Life, Digital Liberty and the pursuit of Digital Happiness**. That to secure these rights, Digital Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Digital Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Digital Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Digital Safety and Happiness.
