## ⚔️ GRIEVANCES AGAINST DIGITAL TYRANNY

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Digital Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. 

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Digital Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Digital Government, and to provide new Guards for their future digital security.

Such has been the patient sufferance of these Digital Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Digital Government. The history of the present Digital King is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these Digital States.
